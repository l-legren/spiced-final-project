## What's this?

This project was built during my attendance to the Spiced Academy's Web Development Bootcamp in Berlin as my final project.

## Why this?


## Technologies I used

- HTML5, CSS3
- File Storing with AWS S3
- React.js
- Redux
- Node/Express
- PSQL

## Set Up

For security reasons it is required to own an AWS account and create a S3 Bucket and pass AWS credentials so the uploading middleware works.
I addition to the AMW set up it's necessary to create a new PSQL Database and edit the ```db.js``` file that can be found in this repo.
To make it run just clone the repository, install all the dependencies with ```npm install``` and from the local directory in the terminal run it with ```node .```.
